# Termux-Python Toolkit 🐍📱
Run Python scripts seamlessly on Android via Termux with pre-configured tools and libraries.

# Key Features•✅
✅ One-click Python environment setup for Termux

📦 Pre-installed libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Requests, OpenCV (with Termux compatibility patches)

# 🔧 Android-specific optimizations:

Access device sensors (GPS, camera via Termux-API)

Notification integratio

Background task management

🚀 Performance tweaks for ARM architectures

# Quick Start

pkg install git python

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/termux-python.git

cd termux-python

./setup.sh

# Use Cases

Mobile data scraping/automation

IoT projects using Android as a hub

On-the-go ML prototyping (with TensorFlow Lite support)

# Compatibility

Termux (F-Droid recommended) to 

Android 8.0+ (ARMv7/ARM64)

# Why This Stands Out

1.Termux-Specific Fixes: Resolves common issues like libopenblas conflicts.

2.Battery-Friendly: Sleep/wake aware scripting.

3.No Root Required: Works on stock Android.

# Contributions welcome! Especially for:

Better hardware acceleration
